I'm too lazy for a proper template, but this kinda works nicely somehow.
Maybe I'll use this over my old template...

Warning: good code nowhere to be found.

Usage instructions:
1. Put session into `.session`
2. Run `./get <day>` (opens VSCode and default browser)
3. Write some code
4. Run `cabal run dayxx`
